# News App

## Overview

This Android application leverages "The Guardian" API to fetch news articles using the Retrofit library. The retrieved data is stored in a Room database for efficient offline access. The app features a user-friendly interface with a ViewPager containing six different pages (fragments), each focusing on a specific subject such as sports, science, general news, society, and more.

## Features

1. **API Integration**: Utilizes Retrofit to interact with "The Guardian" API and fetch the latest news articles.

2. **Offline Storage**: Saves retrieved data in a Room database for offline access, ensuring users can read news even without an active internet connection.

3. **ViewPager with Fragments**: Organizes news content into a ViewPager with separate fragments for different subjects, providing a seamless browsing experience.

4. **Pagination**: Implements pagination to continuously fetch data from the API as users scroll down, ensuring a constant stream of up-to-date news articles.

5. **RecyclerView**: Uses RecyclerView to display news items, enabling efficient handling of large data sets and smooth scrolling.

6. **Sharing Functionality**: Enables users to share individual news articles using implicit intents.

7. **WebView Integration**: Allows users to tap on news items, opening a WebView fragment for a more detailed view of the article.

8. **Shared Preferences**: Utilizes Shared Preferences to store user preferences, including options for adjusting font size, selecting themes, and setting a specific date to filter news articles.

9. **Navigation Drawer**: Incorporates a navigation drawer for easy navigation between fragments, providing an alternative to swiping through the ViewPager.
