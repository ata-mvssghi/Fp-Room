# News App

## Overview

This Android application leverages "The Guardian" API to fetch news articles using the Retrofit library. The retrieved data is stored in a Room database for efficient offline access. The app features a user-friendly interface with a ViewPager containing six different pages (fragments), each focusing on a specific subject such as sports, science, general news, society, and more.
